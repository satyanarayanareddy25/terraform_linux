A Linux server on AWS that serves as a basic web server.

## Terraform Project Execution Guide

This guide will help you set up and execute the Terraform configuration to deploy infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Terraform**  
   Make sure Terraform is installed on your system. You can [download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) if necessary.

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**  
   Configure your AWS credentials with the required permissions to create and manage resources. You can set up credentials by running:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Or by setting environment variables:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
   ```

## Execution Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/satyanarayanareddy25/terraform_linux.git
cd terraform_linux
```

### 2. Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize the project. This downloads necessary provider plugins:
```bash
terraform init
```

### 3. Review and Configure Variables
If there is a `variables.tf` file, review the required variables. You may need to create a `terraform.tfvars` file to set values.  
Example `terraform.tfvars`:
```hcl
# terraform.tfvars example
region = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

### 4. Run Terraform Plan
This command shows what resources will be created. Review the output before applying changes:
```bash
terraform plan
```

### 5. Apply Terraform Configuration
To create the resources, run:
```bash
terraform apply
```
Confirm the apply step when prompted.

### 6. Connect to Your Linux Instance
Once applied, you can connect to your instance with SSH. Replace `<path-to-your-private-key>` with your private key file and `<instance-public-ip>` with the public IP of your instance:
```bash
ssh -i <path-to-your-private-key> ubuntu@<instance-public-ip>
```

### 7. Cleanup
To delete the resources created, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Terraform Project Execution Guide

This guide will help you set up and execute the Terraform configuration to deploy infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Terraform**  
   Make sure Terraform is installed on your system. You can [download Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) if necessary.

2. **Set Up AWS Credentials**  
   Configure your AWS credentials with the required permissions to create and manage resources. You can set up credentials by running:
   ```bash
   aws configure
Or by setting environment variables:

bash
Copy code
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
Execution Steps
1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/satyanarayanareddy25/terraform_linux.git
cd terraform_linux
2. Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize the project. This downloads necessary provider plugins:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
3. Review and Configure Variables
If there is a variables.tf file, review the required variables. You may need to create a terraform.tfvars file to set values.
Example terraform.tfvars:

hcl
Copy code
# terraform.tfvars example
region = "us-west-2"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
4. Run Terraform Plan
This command shows what resources will be created. Review the output before applying changes:

bash
Copy code
terraform plan
5. Apply Terraform Configuration
To create the resources, run:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Confirm the apply step when prompted.

6. Connect to Your Linux Instance
Once applied, you can connect to your instance with SSH. Replace <path-to-your-private-key> with your private key file and <instance-public-ip> with the public IP of your instance:

bash
Copy code
ssh -i <path-to-your-private-key> ubuntu@<instance-public-ip>
7. Cleanup
To delete the resources created, run:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
